Draw Your Own Wheels

This is an experimental browser-based game that explores what happens when a car has to drive using wheels you draw by hand.

Features:
Freehand draw a single wheel shape
The car uses your drawing as both wheels (side view)
Real-time movement affected by your drawing's quality

Built With:
React + TypeScript – App structure and UI
HTML Canvas – Drawing and animation
Custom physics – To simulate wheel shape effects

How It Works:
Draw a closed loop (ideally circular)
The shape is duplicated to become two car wheels
The car drives automatically from the left edge of the canvas
If your shape is bad, the car struggles—if it's good, it rolls smoothly

Disclaimer:
This is an experimental project. The car’s behavior depends entirely on your ability to draw decent circles.
