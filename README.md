# Draw Your Own Wheels

A silly little browser game where your drawing skills determine how well your car drives. Draw a perfect circle, and your car cruises smoothly. Draw something wonky... well, good luck with that ride.

## What's This All About?

You know how kids draw wobbly circles and call them wheels? This game takes that idea and runs with it. You draw a shape, and the game turns it into actual wheels for a car. The better your circle, the smoother the ride. If your drawing skills aren't quite Leonardo da Vinci level, you'll get to watch your car bounce and wobble down the road in style.

## How to Play

Just three simple steps:
1. Draw something roughly circle-shaped on the canvas
2. Watch as it becomes the wheels for your car
3. Laugh at (or admire) the results of your artistic skills

Your car will use the exact shape you drew for both wheels. Draw well, and you'll get a smooth ride. Draw badly, and... let's just say it's entertaining.

## Try It Yourself

Want to give it a shot? Here's how to get it running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nijamitsu/circle-car-game.git
cd circle-car-game
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open up your browser and prepare to question your circle-drawing abilities.

## The Tech Stuff

Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite because sometimes you need modern tools to properly simulate wonky wheels. Uses HTML Canvas for drawing and some basic physics to make your questionable circles come to life as arguably functional wheels.

Works on both desktop and mobile, so you can create entertaining vehicular disasters wherever you go.
